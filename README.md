\# Splunk BOTS v1 (Boss of the SOC) Walkthrough

This repository contains my complete walkthrough of \*\*Boss of the SOC (BOTS) v1\*\*, Splunk’s premier blue team CTF event first launched at .conf2016. The scenario centers around a fictional cyberattack on Wayne Corporation (yes, \*that\* Wayne), involving web defacement, brute-force attacks, malware analysis, and DNS abuse.

\#\# 🔍 Scenario Summary

The challenge places participants in the role of a security analyst investigating a defaced CEO blog and uncovering a broader attack involving:

\- Acunetix vulnerability scanning  
\- Typosquatted domains  
\- Malicious \`.exe\` downloads  
\- Brute force password spraying  
\- Dynamic DNS usage  
\- IOC correlation and Splunk search optimization

All analysis was performed using \*\*Splunk Enterprise\*\* and focused on building practical detection skills with \`search\`, \`rex\`, and visualization.

\#\# 🖼️ Screenshots

All steps are documented with annotated screenshots found in the \`images/\` directory and embedded directly into the write-up.

\#\# 🧠 Skills Practiced

\- Threat hunting and log analysis in Splunk  
\- IOC enrichment with VirusTotal and AlienVault OTX  
\- Regex pattern extraction (\`rex\`)  
\- Brute-force and password spray detection  
\- Cybersecurity storytelling and reporting

\#\# 📌 Notes

This scenario was entirely self-guided and performed for training purposes to improve incident response and SOC analyst capabilities. I used no automation tools—only Splunk, research, and persistence.

🎯 Inspired by real-world attack patterns, BOTS v1 sharpened my investigative workflow and reinforced my understanding of how cyberattacks unfold in enterprise environments.
